# Curly Girl Project

## Summary

This is my very first web application. For this project I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This was a personal project that I worked on with some guidance from my husband (who is a Senior Full-Stack Developer). It is a silly quiz that walks you through the "Curly Girl Routine". There are several questions, each question has two choices. If the "incorrect" choice is selected, a phrase is displayed and you can then select the other choice. The user is then able to select the "correct" choices to make it to the end of the quiz.

I created this app to dip my toes into web development and to share with fellow "Curly Girls". I am a part of a social media group that follows the Curly Girl Method which is just a way to style curly hair (because it's not easy!).
